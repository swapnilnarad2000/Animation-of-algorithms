# Animation-of-algorithms
* Languages used : cytoscape.js(Build v3.12.1) library from Javascript,HTML5,CSS.
* For generating animation you will require code.js , cytoscape.min.js , index.html , style.css in same folder.
* You will need a browser to run the index.html file(no internet required).
* INSRUCTIONS STEPS:
* (1)You can run animation by using the default graph already generated in index.html.
* (2)You have to enter start vertex in text box provided at top.
* (3)Use <Generate BFS> and <Generate DFS> button to produce animation after providing start vertex.
* (4)Generate MST by simply clicking on <Generate MST> button provided at the bottom.
* (5)You can also create your own custon graph:
  a)Just add no. of nodes and click <Generate Nodes> button.
	b)Then add edge source and destination also provide weight for each edge.
	c)Use <Generate Edge> after each edge source,destination and weight provided.
	d)Then we can start bfs and dfs by providing start vertex and using <Generate BFS> and <Generate DFS> button provided at the top.
	e)Generate MST by simply clicking on <Generate MST> button provided at the bottom.
* While generating the custom graph the vertices may overlap so please drag them for convenience.**
* <Reload> button is provided to which resets the page to default graph status.**
